# PositiveOrNegativeComment

## Project Overview
PositiveOrNegativeComment is a machine learning application designed to classify user comments as either positive or negative. The project leverages Python and various machine learning libraries for data processing and model training, and utilizes Django for the web interface. The application is tailored to handle comments in both Malagasy and English, but the responses are always provided in Malagasy.

## Features

### 1. Data Preprocessing:
- Tokenization: Splitting comments into individual words.
- Stop Words Removal: Filtering out common words that do not contribute to sentiment analysis.
- Stemming/Lemmatization: Reducing words to their root forms

### 2. Programming Language:
Python is used as the core language for data processing and machine learning tasks

### 3. Libraries:
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning model development.
- NLTK: For natural language processing tasks.
- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- joblib: For model storage and loading.

### 4. Web Framework:
Django is used for building the web application interface
